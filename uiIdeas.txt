implement UI to allow shift of the num of planets, size, mass, orbit
let people label and attach info about it which will be displayed when user clicks on a planet 
OR attach information about the planet (size, temparature, distance from a sun) in the code and display when user clicks on it (probably too much work)
-look up how to do gui for python
-parallel processing?
